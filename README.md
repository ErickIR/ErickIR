## 👋 Hey, I'm Erick Ivan Restituyo Caba

I'm a backend engineer passionate about building reliable and scalable systems. I primarily work with **Golang**, but I also enjoy writing **.NET**, **Python**, and **Ruby** when the project calls for it. I thrive in backend development but can also hold my own on the frontend and in CI/CD pipelines.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Go, Ruby, Python, C#, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Gin, .NET, Rails, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, Docker, Git, AWS
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis

### 🚀 What I'm Up To
- 🔭 Currently building backend services in Go
- 🌱 Exploring scalable microservice architectures
- 💬 Happy to chat about backend design, Golang, and developer workflows
